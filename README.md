## Features
* **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Explore systems where multiple AI agents work together to solve complex tasks.
* **Framework Diversity:** Examples using CrewAI, LangChain, and pure Python approaches.
* **Coding Focus:** Projects emphasize code generation, debugging, and reasoning with LLMs.
* **Workshops and Tutorials:** Step-by-step guidance for building and experimenting with AI agents.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lorenzouriel/coding-ai-agents.git
cd coding-ai-agents
```

2. Explore individual projects:
* `coding-llm` â€“ LLM-powered coding assistants
* `coding-mcp` â€“ Multi-agent collaborative coding
* `crewai` â€“ Multi-agent philosophical and reasoning projects
* `langchain` â€“ LangChain-based agents
* `no-framework` â€“ Pure Python agent experiments
* `workshop-ai-agents` â€“ Hands-on tutorials

Each subproject has its own instructions.
