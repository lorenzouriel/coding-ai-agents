### Install the required dependencies using the CrewAI CLI:
```bash
crewai install
```

This command will:
- ead the dependencies from your project configuration
- Create a virtual environment if needed
- Install all required packages
​
### Run Your Crew
Now for the exciting moment - it’s time to run your crew and see AI collaboration in action!
```bash
crewai run
```

When you run this command, you’ll see your crew spring to life. The researcher will gather information about the specified topic, and the analyst will then create a comprehensive report based on that research. You’ll see the agents’ thought processes, actions, and outputs in real-time as they work together to complete their tasks.

## Review the Output
Once the crew completes its work, you’ll find the final report in the output/report.md file. The report will include:
1. An executive summary
2. Detailed information about the topic
3. Analysis and insights
4. Recommendations or future considerations
