# L2: Create Agents to Research and Write an Article
The libraries are already installed in the classroom. If you're running this notebook on your own machine, you can install the following:
```Python
!pip install crewai==0.28.8 crewai_tools==0.1.6 langchain_community==0.0.29
```

- Import from the crewAI library
```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

import os
from utils import get_openai_api_key

openai_api_key = get_openai_api_key()
os.environ["OPENAI_MODEL_NAME"] = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
```

## Creating Agents
- Define your Agents, and provide them a `role`, `goal` and `backstory`.
- It has been seen that LLMs perform better when they are role playing.

### Agent: Planner
**Note**: The benefit of using _multiple strings_ :
```Python
varname = "line 1 of text"
          "line 2 of text"
```
versus the _triple quote docstring_:
```Python
varname = """line 1 of text
             line 2 of text
          """
```
is that it can avoid adding those whitespaces and newline characters, making it better formatted to be passed to the LLM.

```python
planner = Agent(
    role="Content Planner",
    goal="Plan engaging and factually accurate content on {topic}",
    backstory="You're working on planning a blog article "
              "about the topic: {topic}."
              "You collect information that helps the "
              "audience learn something "
              "and make informed decisions. "
              "Your work is the basis for "
              "the Content Writer to write an article on this topic.",
    allow_delegation=False,
	verbose=True
)
```

### Agent: Writer
```python
writer = Agent(
    role="Content Writer",
    goal="Write insightful and factually accurate "
         "opinion piece about the topic: {topic}",
    backstory="You're working on a writing "
              "a new opinion piece about the topic: {topic}. "
              "You base your writing on the work of "
              "the Content Planner, who provides an outline "
              "and relevant context about the topic. "
              "You follow the main objectives and "
              "direction of the outline, "
              "as provide by the Content Planner. "
              "You also provide objective and impartial insights "
              "and back them up with information "
              "provide by the Content Planner. "
              "You acknowledge in your opinion piece "
              "when your statements are opinions "
              "as opposed to objective statements.",
    allow_delegation=False,
    verbose=True
)
```

### Agent: Editor
```python
editor = Agent(
    role="Editor",
    goal="Edit a given blog post to align with "
         "the writing style of the organization. ",
    backstory="You are an editor who receives a blog post "
              "from the Content Writer. "
              "Your goal is to review the blog post "
              "to ensure that it follows journalistic best practices,"
              "provides balanced viewpoints "
              "when providing opinions or assertions, "
              "and also avoids major controversial topics "
              "or opinions when possible.",
    allow_delegation=False,
    verbose=True
)
```

## Creating Tasks
- Define your Tasks, and provide them a `description`, `expected_output` and `agent`.

### Task: Plan
```python
plan = Task(
    description=(
        "1. Prioritize the latest trends, key players, "
            "and noteworthy news on {topic}.\n"
        "2. Identify the target audience, considering "
            "their interests and pain points.\n"
        "3. Develop a detailed content outline including "
            "an introduction, key points, and a call to action.\n"
        "4. Include SEO keywords and relevant data or sources."
    ),
    expected_output="A comprehensive content plan document "
        "with an outline, audience analysis, "
        "SEO keywords, and resources.",
    agent=planner,
)
```

### Task: Write
```python
write = Task(
    description=(
        "1. Use the content plan to craft a compelling "
            "blog post on {topic}.\n"
        "2. Incorporate SEO keywords naturally.\n"
		"3. Sections/Subtitles are properly named "
            "in an engaging manner.\n"
        "4. Ensure the post is structured with an "
            "engaging introduction, insightful body, "
            "and a summarizing conclusion.\n"
        "5. Proofread for grammatical errors and "
            "alignment with the brand's voice.\n"
    ),
    expected_output="A well-written blog post "
        "in markdown format, ready for publication, "
        "each section should have 2 or 3 paragraphs.",
    agent=writer,
)
```

### Task: Edit
```python
edit = Task(
    description=("Proofread the given blog post for "
                 "grammatical errors and "
                 "alignment with the brand's voice."),
    expected_output="A well-written blog post in markdown format, "
                    "ready for publication, "
                    "each section should have 2 or 3 paragraphs.",
    agent=editor
)
```

## Creating the Crew
- Create your crew of Agents
- Pass the tasks to be performed by those agents.
    - **Note**: *For this simple example*, the tasks will be performed sequentially (i.e they are dependent on each other), so the _order_ of the task in the list _matters_.
- `verbose=2` allows you to see all the logs of the execution. 
```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[planner, writer, editor],
    tasks=[plan, write, edit],
    verbose=2
)
```

## Running the Crew
**Note**: LLMs can provide different outputs for they same input, so what you get might be different than what you see in the video.
```python
result = crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "Artificial Intelligence"})
```
