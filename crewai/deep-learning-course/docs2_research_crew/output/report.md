**2. Key Developments in Surf Weather Forecasting**

**2.1 Satellite Imagery**

Satellite imagery has become a cornerstone of modern surf weather forecasting. Satellites provide high-resolution images of ocean conditions, enabling forecasters to track wave heights, wind patterns, and storm systems in real-time. This data is particularly valuable for identifying swells and predicting when they will reach specific coastlines.

**2.2 Wave Models**

Wave models, such as the WAVEWATCH III (WW3) model, are sophisticated tools that simulate wave conditions based on wind, fetch, and other environmental factors. These models allow surfers to anticipate wave heights, periods, and directions with greater accuracy than ever before. The WW3 model, in particular, is widely regarded for its precision in predicting wave behavior across different regions.

**2.3 Real-Time Data from Buoys**

A network of buoys deployed across the world's oceans provides real-time data on wave conditions, sea surface temperature, and wind speed. This data is fed into forecasting models, enhancing their accuracy and enabling surfers to make informed decisions based on up-to-the-minute information.
