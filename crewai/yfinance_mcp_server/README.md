# Multi-Agent Analyst â€“ AI Chat Interface

This project is a Streamlit-powered chat interface that connects to a local multi-agent system (FastMCP) capable of answering **financial** and **database-related** questions using **YFinance** and **Supabase** tools, with **per-user memory** powered by OpenAI embeddings.

## Features

- Intelligent agent using `CrewAI` and `LangChain`
- Financial queries via YFinance MCP tool
- Database queries via Supabase MCP tool
- Per-user memory with RAG storage (OpenAI embeddings)
- Interactive chat UI built with Streamlit
- Tool orchestration through `FastMCP`

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lorenzouriel/ai-agent-with-fastmcp.git
cd ai-agent-with-fastmcp
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
> Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-supabase-access-token
```

### 4. Start the FastMCP Server
```bash
python src/mcp_server.py
```

This runs the backend multi-agent system on:
- `http://127.0.0.1:8005/sse`


### 5. Start the Streamlit Frontend
In a **new terminal** tab:
```bash
streamlit run src/streamlit_app.py
```

This launches the chat UI on:
- `http://localhost:8501`

## Example Usage
* Ask: `What is the current price of AAPL?`
* Ask: `Create a table and add the stock data from AAPL`
* Ask: `What was Amazon's stock performance over the past year?`

The system automatically chooses the best tool and formats the response as:
* A table (via pandas)
* JSON output
* Plain text

## Notes
* You must have Node.js installed to run the Supabase and YFinance MCP tools via `npx`.
* The memory is stored per-user using UUIDs and RAG with OpenAI embeddings.
* Compatible with `gpt-4.1-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small`.
