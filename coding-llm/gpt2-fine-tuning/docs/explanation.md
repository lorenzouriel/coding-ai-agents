# Explanation

## Imports
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from datasets import load_dataset
```

**What / Why**
* `AutoTokenizer` and `AutoModelForCausalLM`: convenient factory classes from Hugging Face that load the correct tokenizer/model for a given model name (here `"gpt2"`). `AutoModelForCausalLM` loads a model architecture suited to causal language modeling (predict next token).
* `Trainer` and `TrainingArguments`: high-level training loop and configuration helper provided by Transformers so you don’t have to write the full training loop yourself.
* `load_dataset` (from `datasets`): easy way to read text files (and many public datasets) into the Dataset object that integrates with `Trainer`.

## 1. Load tokenizer and model
```python
model_name = "gpt2"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

**What / Why**
* `model_name = "gpt2"` picks the pretrained checkpoint. You can replace with any HF model ID (`"distilgpt2"`, or larger ones).
* `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(...)`: downloads (or loads locally) the tokenizer configuration and vocabulary. Tokenizers convert text ↔ token ids.
* `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(...)`: loads model weights and architecture for causal LM (suitable for text generation). Using a pre-trained LM is almost always recommended vs. training from scratch.

**Notes**
* Make sure you have enough GPU memory for the model you choose. GPT-2 small is modest; larger models require more RAM / VRAM.

## GPT-2 needs a padding token
```python
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token
```

**What / Why**
* GPT-2’s pretrained tokenizer historically **doesn’t include a `pad_token`** because it was trained without padding (all training used contiguous streams). Many training utilities (batching, DataCollators) expect a `pad_token`.
* Setting `pad_token = eos_token` is a simple hack: it uses the end-of-sequence token as the padding token so you can batch sequences of different lengths without changing model embeddings.
* Alternative: add a new pad token `tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"pad_token":"<PAD>"})` **and** then call `model.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer))` so the model learns an embedding for the new token. Using `eos_token` is quicker but note it semantically collapses PAD==EOS which can have subtle effects.

**Pitfall**
* If you add a new pad token, you must resize the model embeddings (see above) or you’ll get shape mismatch errors.

## 2. Load dataset
```python
dataset = load_dataset("text", data_files={"train": "train.txt", "validation": "val.txt"})
```

**What / Why**
* Loads the two plain text files into a `DatasetDict` with `train` and `validation` splits.
* Each row of the dataset will have a `"text"` field containing one line (by default the `text` loader treats file lines as examples).

**Notes**
* If your `train.txt` contains very long documents per line, consider preprocessing (splitting into chunks) or use `dataset = load_dataset("text", data_files=..., split="train", streaming=True)` for very large datasets.

## 3. Tokenize
```python
def tokenize(batch):
    return tokenizer(batch["text"], truncation=True, padding="max_length", max_length=64)

tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize, batched=True)
```

**What / Why**
* `tokenizer(...)` turns raw text into token ids (`input_ids`), attention masks (`attention_mask`), and possibly other tokenizer outputs.
* `truncation=True`: if a text is longer than `max_length`, it will be cut down to `max_length`.
* `padding="max_length"`: every example is padded to `max_length` tokens (fixed-length). This makes batches uniform.
* `max_length=64`: defines the sequence length used for training. Shorter sequences are padded; longer sequences are truncated to 64 tokens.

**Why batched map?**
* `dataset.map(..., batched=True)` applies the tokenizer to multiple examples at once (faster and more efficient).

**What results from `.map`**
* `tokenized_dataset` now contains columns like `input_ids` and `attention_mask` (in addition to the original `text` unless removed).

**Improvements you’ll want**
* For causal LM training you should set labels. A common pattern:
  ```python
  def tokenize(batch):
      tokens = tokenizer(batch["text"], truncation=True, padding="max_length", max_length=64)
      tokens["labels"] = tokens["input_ids"].copy()
      return tokens
  ```

  This makes labels equal to input\_ids so the model learns to predict the next token (standard causal LM objective).
* Optionally call `tokenized_dataset = tokenized_dataset.remove_columns(["text"])` to remove raw text column (saves memory).
* You can also use dynamic padding during batching (via a data collator) instead of `padding="max_length"` to save memory.

## 4. Training arguments (detailed)
```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="steps",
    eval_steps=10,
    logging_steps=5,
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=1,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=1,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    save_total_limit=2,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    fp16=True,  # Use mixed precision if your GPU supports it
    logging_dir='./logs'
)
```

**Key fields explained**
* `output_dir`: where checkpoints and final model are saved.
* `evaluation_strategy="steps"`: run evaluation every `eval_steps` (other options: `"epoch"` or `"no"`).
* `eval_steps=10`: evaluate every 10 training steps (useful for tiny datasets; on large datasets this would be too frequent and slow).
* `logging_steps=5`: log training loss & metrics every 5 steps.
* `learning_rate=5e-5`: optimizer learning rate. Typical starting point for fine-tuning; you may need to tune it.
* `per_device_train_batch_size=1`: batch size per GPU/CPU device. If you set 1 and want larger effective batch, use `gradient_accumulation_steps`.
* `per_device_eval_batch_size=1`: eval batch size.
* `weight_decay=0.01`: L2 regularization on weights to reduce overfitting.
* `save_total_limit=2`: keep only the most recent 2 checkpoints (older ones deleted).
* `num_train_epochs=3`: number of passes through the training dataset.
* `fp16=True`: use mixed precision (16-bit floats) — speeds up training and reduces VRAM usage on modern NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA + apex/torch. If you don’t have a compatible GPU, set to `False`.
* `logging_dir`: directory for TensorBoard logs (if you want to inspect training visually).

**Practical tips**
* If your GPU runs out of memory, reduce `per_device_train_batch_size` or use `gradient_accumulation_steps` to simulate a larger batch size:
```python
# effective batch = per_device_train_batch_size * gradient_accumulation_steps * num_devices
training_args.gradient_accumulation_steps = 8
```
* For very large models, also enable `gradient_checkpointing` on the model to save memory.

## 5. Create Trainer
```python
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_dataset["validation"]
)
```

**What / Why**
* `Trainer` wires up everything: model, args, datasets, optimizer, training loop, evaluation and checkpointing.
* With no `data_collator` provided, `Trainer` uses the default collator which may be fine if all sequences are the same length (we used `padding="max_length"`). For variable-length batches you should pass a collator that pads dynamically:

  ```python
  from transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling
  data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False)  # mlm=False -> causal LM
  trainer = Trainer(..., data_collator=data_collator, tokenizer=tokenizer)
  ```

**Advanced additions**
* `compute_metrics`: function to compute and return metrics during evaluation.
* `callbacks`: hooks to add custom logic at save/eval steps.

## 6. Train
```python
trainer.train()
```

**What / Why**
* Starts the training loop: iterates over train dataset, computes loss, performs backprop and optimizer steps, runs evaluation and saves checkpoints as configured.
* `Trainer` also handles multi-GPU, mixed precision and gradient accumulation under the hood when `TrainingArguments` are set.

**What you’ll see**
* Console logs for training loss, evaluation metrics (if any), and saved checkpoints.

## 7. Save
```python
model.save_pretrained("./my_finetuned_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./my_finetuned_model")
```

**What / Why**
* Persists model weights, configuration and tokenizer files to `./my_finetuned_model`.
* You can later reload with `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("./my_finetuned_model")` and `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./my_finetuned_model")`.
* Optionally push to Hugging Face Hub with `model.push_to_hub(...)` / `tokenizer.push_to_hub(...)`.
